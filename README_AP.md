Project Overview
---------------------
This project aims to analyze the trends in median household costs across California counties over the past ten years, alongside what the most popular work industries are in these counties. Given the significant rise in housing costs in recent years, we intend to investigate whether certain work industries are more common amongst affluent and non-affluent counties, affluence being defined by the median household costs.

This project explores the relationship between median household 
costs and work industries across California counties. We aim to 
uncover trends in housing prices and industry distribution over the 
past decade.
Our analysis will provide insights into economic patterns and 
potential correlations between housing affordability and 
employment sectors.

Project Questions
---------------------
- How much has the median household value changed in each California county from 2010 to present day?
- Which California counties have the highest and lowest median household values?
- What are the most popular work industries in each California county?
- Do counties with higher median household costs have more people working in a specific industry than those who work in counties with lower median household costs?
