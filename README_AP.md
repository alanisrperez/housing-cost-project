Project Overview
---------------------
This project aims to analyze the trends in median household costs across California counties over the past ten years, alongside what the most popular work industries are in these counties. Given the significant rise in housing costs in recent years, we intend to investigate whether certain work industries are more common amongst affluent and non-affluent counties, affluence being defined by the median household costs.
