Project Overview
---------------------
This project aims to analyze the trends in median household costs across California counties over the past ten years, alongside what the most popular work industries are in these counties. Given the significant rise in housing costs in recent years, we intend to investigate whether certain work industries are more common amongst affluent and non-affluent counties, affluence being defined by the median household costs. 

Project Questions
---------------------
- How much has the median household value changed over the last ~15 years?
-- How much does this vary by county?
- What industries have the largest work forces in each county?
- Is there a relationship between industry and household value?

Resources
---------------------
Housing Data - Zillow Research — Median home value by county
- (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)
Employment by Industry Data (ca.gov) — Employment numbers per industry by county
- (https://labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/data/employment-by-industry.html)
